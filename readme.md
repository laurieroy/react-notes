# NOTES - frontend	React
Frontend for the Notes API. I'll build it in Vue also, but this is just a test for connecting projects. I had issues the first time, so I'm using React 16 and Router 5.2 to use similar to what he is during the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l06kR6Z250&list=PLY6oTPmKnKbYNIC0Yq3Cc6mgHZrWiZcJU&index=5). Have an app-level state in AppState.

This is a minimalistic webpack react build. Best for practicing react, doesn't have many of the testing and post-processing features other builds have. Although you can add webpack and babel plugins as you wish if you want to use this as a starting place for a more powerful build setup.

Make sure to remove the git repository

`sudo rm -r .git` from the root folder

Otherwise...

`npm run dev` to run dev server
`npm run build` to build into build folder

- sass is enabled, so feel free to use sass files
